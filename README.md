## Briefing

Coach comes fully equipped with:
- [x]  Basic UI settings
- [x]  Import/export functionality
- [x]  Board annotations
- [x]  ECO interpreter
- [ ]  Syzygy interpreter
- [ ]  Stockfish bot with variable skill
- [ ]  Coach's own chess bot!

The GUI is *unspeakably* simple, give it a whirl.


#### Dependencies

Fully specified in `dependencies.txt`, surpringly.

Nothing heavy.
Only one of coach's many talents requires a live internet connection (Stockfish bot), but it's optional.



#### ECO Interpreter

My openings database is based on the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings.
To ensure coach works offline, I cleaned & converted the entire ECO catalogue to CSV format.

ETL details soon.


#### Coachbot

Soon.
