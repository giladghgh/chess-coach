# Chess Coach

#### My attempt at a simple chess platform, meant to help explore openings and endgames.

## Briefing

Coach comes fully equipped with:
- [x]  Basic UI settings
- [x]  Import/export functionality
- [x]  Board annotations
- [x]  ECO interpreter
- [ ]  Syzygy interpreter
- [ ]  Stockfish bot with variable skill
- [ ]  Coach's own chess bot!

The GUI is *unspeakably* simple. Give it a whirl.


#### Dependencies

These are fully specified in the `dependencies.txt` file, surprisingly. Just run these:

- `pip install pygame`
- `pip install chess`


#### ECO Interpreter

My openings database is based on the Encyclopedia of Chess Openings.
To ensure coach works offline, I cleaned & converted the entire ECO catalogue to CSV format.

ETL details soon.


#### Coachbot

Soon.
