<br>

#### My attempt at a simple chess platform, to help explore openings and endgames.

## Briefing

Coach comes fully equipped with:
- [x]  Basic UI settings
- [x]  Import/export functionality
- [x]  Board annotations
- [x]  Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) interpreter
- [ ]  Syzygy interpreter
- [ ]  Stockfish bot with variable skill
- [ ]  Coach's own bot!

The GUI is *unspeakably* simple, give it a whirl.



### Dependencies

**Libraries**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fully [WIP] specified in `dependencies.txt`, surpringly.

**Internet**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just _one_ of coach's many talents requires a live internet connection (Stockfish bot [WIP]), only once, on the first run. Anywhichway, it's optional [WIP].



### ECO Interpreter

My openings database is based on the [Encyclopedia of Chess Openings](https://www.365chess.com/eco.php).
So that coach works offline, I cleaned & converted this ECO catalogue to CSV format. ETL details soon.



### Coachbot

[WIP]



### License
