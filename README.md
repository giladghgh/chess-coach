# Chess Coach

#### My attempt at a simple chess platform, meant to help explore openings and endgames.

## Briefing

I built everything from the ground up, using minimal dependencies and even creating many of the icons myself.

Includes:
- [x]  Basic UI settings
- [x]  Import/export functionality
- [x]  Board annotations
- [ ]  ECO interpreter
- [ ]  Stockfish bot with variable skill
- [ ]  My own chess bot

The GUI is *unbelievably* simple to use. Not much else to say here, just give it a whirl.


#### Dependencies

Fully specified in the `.txt` file, run these CLI commands first:

- `pip install pygame`
- `pip install chess`
