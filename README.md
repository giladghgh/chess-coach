## Briefing

Coach comes fully equipped with [WIP]:
- [x]  Basic UI settings
- [x]  Import/export functionality
- [x]  Board annotations
- [x]  Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) interpreter
- [ ]  Syzygy interpreter
- [ ]  Stockfish bot with variable skill
- [ ]  Coach's own bot!

The GUI is *unspeakably* simple [WIP], give it a whirl.



### Dependencies

**Libraries**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully specified in `dependencies.txt`, surpringly.

**Internet**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just _one_ of coach's many talents requires a live internet connection (Stockfish bot [WIP]), only once, on the first run. Anywhichway, it's optional.



### ECO Interpreter

My openings database [WIP] is based on the [Encyclopedia of Chess Openings](https://www.365chess.com/eco.php).
So that coach works offline [WIP], I cleaned & converted this ECO catalogue to CSV format [WIP]. ETL details soon.
[WORK IN PROGRESS]
